# pocket_sonnet

This project is a mobile app designed to help users write short poems using a template. This template provides images and titles from objects in the Metropolitan Museum of Art collections, using the Met Collections API. Using randomly-generated images and artwork titles as inspiration, app users can write their own original poems.

## Intended audience

Poets of any experience level can use this app, but the guided template is particularly useful for new poets. The provided images and title can help new writers overcome the initial hurdle of the "blank page."

## Met API

The app uses the Metropolitan Museum of Art API, which accesses the Met's open-access dataset. Images from the dataset are in the public domain. For more information, see https://metmuseum.github.io/.
